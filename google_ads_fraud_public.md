# THE GOOGLE ADS FRAUD THAT GOOGLE TRIED TO COVER UP

## The Impossible Numbers

Look at this screenshot from a YouTube channel:

**31,800 subscribers**  
**9,145 total views**

Wait... how does that work?

To subscribe to a YouTube channel, you have to view content first. That's how YouTube works. You watch a video, you like it, you subscribe.

So how does a channel have **3.5 times MORE subscribers than total views**?

It doesn't. Unless the subscribers are fake.

## What Happened

In March 2025, a content creator paid Google Ads **$2,100** to promote their YouTube channel—a professionally-produced Barcelona FC anthem targeting the club's 330+ million global fanbase.

Google Ads reported the campaign as a massive success:
- **33,448 subscribers gained**
- **78% conversion rate** (industry standard is 8-12%)
- **"Outstanding performance"** according to their metrics

But there was a problem.

**The subscribers weren't real.**

---

## The Math Doesn't Lie

When you look at the actual YouTube channel analytics:

**During the campaign:**
- Google Ads reported: 33,448 conversions (subscribers)
- YouTube showed: ~4,000 total video views
- Ratio: 8+ subscribers per view

**Eight months later (today):**
- Subscribers: 31,800 (losing ~7 per day)
- Total views: 9,145
- Ratio: Still 3.5+ subscribers per view

**This is mathematically impossible.**

You cannot subscribe to a YouTube channel without viewing content first. Period.

Yet somehow, 31,800 people subscribed while only 9,145 views were recorded across all videos over 10 months.

**Either:**
1. YouTube's view counter is broken (it's not)
2. The subscribers are fake (they are)

---

## The Campaign Metrics Were Even Worse

The Google Ads dashboard showed impossibilities beyond just the subscriber count:

### 1. MORE CONVERSIONS THAN CLICKS
One ad reported:
- **3,550 clicks**
- **3,620 conversions**

That's physically impossible. A user must click an ad before they can convert. You can't have more conversions than clicks—that violates basic cause and effect.

### 2. IMPOSSIBLE CONVERSION RATES
The overall campaign reported:
- **41,128 clicks**
- **32,224 conversions**
- **78.36% conversion rate**

Google's own documentation states that **8-12% is normal** (with 12% being considered "high-end").

This campaign allegedly achieved **6.5x the highest normal rate**.

### 3. SUBSCRIBERS WITHOUT VIEWS
- **26,431 "earned subscribers"** (people who subscribed after seeing the ad)
- **1,939 "earned views"** (people who watched other videos after seeing the ad)

That's a 13.6-to-1 ratio. Thirteen subscribers for every single view.

**How do 26,000 people subscribe to a channel after seeing an ad but only 1,900 of them watch even one video?**

They don't. Not if they're real people.

---

## What Happened When the Campaign Stopped

The moment the ad campaign was paused:

✅ All subscriber growth stopped completely  
✅ No organic momentum continued  
✅ Engagement flatlined immediately  
✅ The channel became a graveyard  

**Eight months later:**
- Lost 1,648 subscribers (still declining)
- Only gained ~5,000 additional views (no organic growth)
- Channel is completely dead
- Zero algorithm pickup
- Zero community engagement

**Real subscribers don't behave this way.**

When you gain 33,000 real, engaged subscribers:
- They come back to watch new content
- They share videos with others
- They comment and engage
- They attract more organic subscribers
- The algorithm picks up the momentum

**None of that happened.**

Because they were never real subscribers.

---

## The Support Nightmare

When the creator noticed these impossible metrics and contacted Google Ads support:

**March 2025 - Initial Contact:**
- Multiple support representatives deflected
- Blamed "user behavior" (despite mathematical impossibilities)
- Referred to YouTube Analytics (ignoring Google Ads' own contradictions)
- Refused to connect to technical specialists
- Provided contradictory explanations

**The representatives couldn't explain:**
- How you get more conversions than clicks
- How you get 78% conversion rates
- How you get 13 subscribers per view
- Why all engagement stopped when ads paused

Instead, they gave circular non-answers and ended calls when pressed.

---

## Then Something Very Strange Happened

### March 14, 2025, 5:55 PM ET

After weeks of the creator documenting these metrics and attempting to get answers, they received a call from Google Ads support.

**Phone number:** (404) 978-8978  
*[This is Google's official Ads support line—verified]*

During the call, the creator received a security prompt on their phone:

> **"We're just checking if the person we're talking to is really you. Are you currently on the phone with a Google Support employee?"**
> 
> Two options:
> - ❌ "No"
> - ✅ "Yes, it's me"

The creator clicked **"No"** because something felt wrong.

Immediately, they received a second message:

> **"Login Attempt Stopped"**  
> **"You prevented a login attempt to your account. Your password wasn't used, so you don't need to take further steps."**

**This wasn't a verification. This was a login attempt.**

If the creator had clicked "Yes," Google would have gained access to:
- Gmail
- Google Drive
- YouTube Channel  
- Google Ads Account
- Every Google service

**The entire call was recorded.**

When the creator asked why Google needed access to their account, the representative became flustered and abruptly hung up.

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about $2,100 or one YouTube channel.

This is about:

### 1. Systematic Fraud
If Google Ads delivered 33,000 fake subscribers to one small creator spending $2,100, how many other advertisers are being defrauded?

Google Ads is a **$200+ billion annual business**. Even a 1% fraud rate would be billions of dollars.

### 2. Fake Metrics
Advertisers make business decisions based on Google's metrics. If those metrics are fake, businesses are making decisions based on lies.

### 3. Platform Manipulation
The fake subscribers destroyed the channel's organic growth potential. YouTube's algorithm likely flagged it as suspicious, suppressing all future content.

The "help" Google sold actually **destroyed** the channel.

### 4. Cover-Up Attempt
When caught, Google didn't investigate.  
They didn't refund.  
They didn't fix.

**They tried to access the creator's account.**

That's not customer service. That's a cover-up.

---

## The Evidence

Everything described here is documented:

✅ **70+ minutes of recorded phone calls** with Google Ads support  
✅ **Full recording of the unauthorized access attempt** (2:10 minutes)  
✅ **Screenshots of all impossible metrics** from Google Ads dashboard  
✅ **YouTube Analytics** showing the dead channel  
✅ **Campaign receipts** showing the $2,100 paid  
✅ **Email correspondence** with multiple Google support teams  
✅ **Timeline documentation** of all events  
✅ **The screenshot above** from November 19, 2025  

The creator has been trying to get lawyers or investigators interested for 8 months.

Now they're going public.

## The Questions Google Needs to Answer

### 1. How does a YouTube channel have 31,800 subscribers but only 9,145 views?

You can't subscribe without viewing. So where did these subscribers come from?

### 2. How does an ad have 3,620 conversions from only 3,550 clicks?

You can't convert without clicking first. This violates basic cause and effect.

### 3. How does a campaign achieve a 78% conversion rate when 8-12% is normal?

What makes this campaign 6.5x more effective than the industry's best performers?

### 4. Why did all engagement stop the moment the campaign ended?

If these were real subscribers interested in the content, wouldn't they continue watching?

### 5. Why did Google attempt to access the creator's account when questioned about these metrics?

What was the purpose of that login attempt?

### 6. If this happened to one small creator, how many others are affected?

Is this a systematic issue or an isolated case?

## What Happens Next

This case involves:

**Federal Wire Fraud** - Charging for services not delivered  
**Computer Fraud** - Unauthorized access attempt to a protected system  
**Deceptive Trade Practices** - Reporting false metrics to extract money  
**Potential RICO violations** - If this is systematic and organized  

The creator is seeking:
- Investigation by appropriate authorities (FTC, DOJ)
- Media coverage to expose the practice
- Legal representation for civil and potential criminal action
- Other affected advertisers to come forward

---

## If This Happened To You

If you've experienced similar issues with Google Ads:
- Impossible conversion rates
- Subscribers/leads that don't engage
- Metrics that don't match reality
- Support that deflects instead of investigating

**You're not alone.**

This may be bigger than one person's $2,100.

---

## The Bottom Line

**A picture is worth a thousand words:**

31,800 subscribers  
9,145 views

**You do the math.**
