## Then Tried To Hack My Account When I Investigated

---

## Look At This Screenshot

**31,800 subscribers**  
**9,145 total views**

**How is that possible?**

To subscribe to a YouTube channel, you have to watch videos first.

So how does a channel have **3.5x MORE subscribers than views?**

**It doesn't. Unless the subscribers are fake.**

## What I Paid For vs. What I Got

### WHAT GOOGLE ADS PROMISED:
✅ Targeted advertising to Barcelona FC fans  
✅ Real, engaged subscribers  
✅ Growth for my channel  

### WHAT GOOGLE ADS DELIVERED:

❌ Zero organic engagement

🚨 I have the call recorded

## The Numbers Don't Work

**My Campaign Results (Google Ads reported):**
- 78% conversion rate *(normal is 0.5-3%, typical is 1%)*
- 3,620 conversions from 3,550 clicks *(more conversions than clicks = impossible)*
- 26,431 subscribers but only 1,939 video views *(13 subs per view = impossible)*

**My Channel After 8 Months:**
- 31,800 subscribers *(losing ~7/day)*
- 9,145 total views *(no organic growth)*
- Completely dead

**Real subscribers watch videos. These don't.**

## The Timeline

**January 20, 2025:** Channel created  
**February 2025:** Ran Google Ads campaign ($2,100)  
**March 2025:** Campaign ends with 33,448 "subscribers"  
**March 14, 2025, 5:55 PM:** Google tries to access my account (recorded)  
**November 19, 2025:** Channel at 31,800 subs, 9,145 views (still dying)

## What Happened When I Called Support

❌ "That's just user behavior" *(for mathematically impossible numbers?)*  
❌ "Contact YouTube Analytics" *(this is YOUR ads platform)*  
❌ "The campaign was successful" *(33,000 ghosts = success?)*  
❌ Representatives hung up when pressed  
❌ Multiple teams deflected for weeks  

**Then they tried to access my account.**

## The Unauthorized Access Attempt

**March 14, 2025 at 5:55 PM ET**

Google called from their official support number: **(404) 978-8978**

During the call, I received this prompt on my phone:

> *"We're checking if you're really you. Are you on the phone with Google Support?"*
>
> [No] or [Yes, it's me]

I clicked **"No"** because it felt wrong.

**Immediately:** *"Login Attempt Stopped - You prevented a login attempt to your account"*

**If I had clicked "Yes":**
- Full access to Gmail
- Full access to Google Drive
- Full access to YouTube
- Full access to Everything

**The entire call is recorded. The rep hung up when I questioned it.**

**Then they went silent:**
- Stopped responding to emails
- Blocked my replies as "forbidden"  
- One week later: Case closed with **no explanation, no results, zero accountability**

**This wasn't customer service. This was a cover-up attempt.**

## This Isn't About $2,100

**This is about:**

🔍 **How many other advertisers are being defrauded?**  
💰 **Google Ads is a $200+ billion/year business**  
⚠️ **If they fake metrics at scale, that's BILLIONS in fraud**  
🚫 **Small businesses making decisions based on fake data**  
💀 **Channels destroyed by fake engagement**  

---

## The Evidence

✅ 70+ minutes of recorded phone calls  
✅ Recording of the unauthorized access attempt  
✅ Screenshots of impossible metrics  
✅ YouTube Analytics showing dead channel  
✅ Campaign receipts ($2,100 paid)  
✅ Email correspondence with support  
✅ Full timeline documented  

**Everything is documented. Everything is preserved.**

## Three Questions For Google

### 1. How does a channel have 31,800 subscribers but only 9,145 views?

You can't subscribe without viewing first.

### 2. How does an ad get more conversions than clicks?

You can't convert without clicking first.

### 3. Why did you try to access my account when I asked about this?

What were you trying to do?

## What I'm Looking For

⚖️ **Legal representation** - Civil and potentially criminal action
