## The Math Doesn't Work

To subscribe to a YouTube channel, you **must view content first**. That's how YouTube works.

So how does a channel have **3.5 times MORE subscribers than total views?**

**It doesn't. Unless the subscribers are fake.**

## I Paid Google Ads $2,100 for These "Subscribers"

**March 2025:** Ran a Google Ads campaign to promote my YouTube channel  
**Result:** Google reported 33,448 "successful conversions" (subscribers)  
**Reality:** The channel is dead, losing subscribers daily, zero organic growth

**The subscribers aren't real. Google charged me for fake metrics.**

---

## Then It Got Much Worse

When I started documenting this fraud and contacting Google support:

**March 14, 2025, 5:55 PM ET** - Google called me from their official support number **(404-978-8978)** and attempted to gain unauthorized access to my entire Google account through a deceptive security prompt.

**I declined. The login attempt was blocked.**

**The entire call is recorded.**

**After the unauthorized access attempt:**
- Google stopped responding to inquiries
- Attempts to reply to support emails were **blocked as "forbidden"**
- After approximately one week of silence: **Case closed with no explanation**
- No resolution, no refund, no investigation results
- Just a blank closure email - case dismissed with zero accountability

## WHAT HAPPENED

**March 2025:**
- Paid Google Ads **$2,100** to promote my YouTube channel
- Google reported **33,448 "successful conversions"** (subscribers)
- Campaign showed **78% conversion rate** (industry standard is 0.5-3%, typical is 1%)

**The Reality:**
- Channel has only **9,145 total views** in 10 months
- Losing subscribers daily (**down to 31,800**)
- **Zero organic growth** after ads stopped
- Channel is completely dead

**The Math:**
- You can't subscribe without viewing first
- Yet: 31,800 subscribers ÷ 9,145 views = 3.48 subs per view
- **Mathematically impossible**

## THEN IT GOT WORSE

When I started documenting the fraud and contacting Google support:

**March 14, 2025, 5:55 PM ET**  
Google called from their official support number: **(404) 978-8978**

During the call, they sent a deceptive security prompt asking me to confirm I was on the phone with them.

**If I had clicked "Yes"**: They would have gained full access to my entire Google account.

**I clicked "No"**: Received immediate confirmation that I had blocked a login attempt.

**The entire call is recorded.**

## THE SMOKING GUNS

### 1. The Impossible Screenshot
**31,800 subscribers | 9,145 views**  
You do the math.

### 2. The Impossible Campaign Metrics
- **More conversions than clicks** (3,620 conversions from 3,550 clicks)
- **78% conversion rate** (6.5x higher than "excellent" performance)
- **26,431 subscribers but only 1,939 video views** (13:1 ratio)

### 3. The Unauthorized Access Attempt
- Recorded call from Google's official number
- Deceptive security prompt
- Login attempt confirmation
- Representative hung up when questioned

### 4. The Dead Channel
- 8 months later, still no organic growth
- Losing subscribers daily
- Fake metrics destroyed the channel's potential

## THE EVIDENCE

Everything is documented:

✅ **70+ minutes** of recorded phone calls with Google support  
✅ **2+ minutes** of the unauthorized access attempt (recorded)  
✅ **Screenshots** of all impossible metrics from Google Ads  
✅ **YouTube Analytics** showing the dead channel  
✅ **Campaign receipts** showing $2,100 paid

## WHY THIS MATTERS

This isn't just about $2,100 or one YouTube channel.

**If Google did this to me, how many others are affected?**

Google Ads is a **$200+ billion annual business**.  
Even 1% fraud rate = **$2 billion stolen**.

**Small businesses are:**
- Making decisions based on fake metrics
- Wasting money on fake conversions
- Having their organic growth destroyed

**And when caught, Google tried to break into my account.**

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**You can't have more subscribers than views.**

**You can't have more conversions than clicks.**

**You can't have 78% conversion rates when 1-3% is normal and 3% is considered excellent.**

**And you definitely can't try to hack someone's account when they question your fraudulent metrics.**

**Google did all of this. I have proof.**
