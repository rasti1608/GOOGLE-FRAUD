## SOCIAL MEDIA POST TEMPLATES:

### Twitter/X:
```
I paid Google Ads $2,100 for YouTube subscribers.

My channel: 31,800 subs, 9,145 views.

Math problem: You can't subscribe without viewing.

When I asked about it, Google tried to access my account.

I have the call recorded.

🧵
```

### Facebook:
```
GOOGLE ADS FRAUD - IMPOSSIBLE NUMBERS

Look at these YouTube stats:
• 31,800 subscribers
• 9,145 total views

How do you get MORE subscribers than views? You can't. To subscribe, you must watch videos first.

I paid Google Ads $2,100 for these "subscribers."

When I investigated, Google called me and tried to gain unauthorized access to my entire Google account. I blocked it and have the call recorded.

Full story: [link]

Share if you think this needs investigation.
```

### Reddit (r/youtube, r/smallbusiness, etc.):
```
Title: Google Ads charged me $2,100 for fake YouTube subscribers, then tried to hack my account when I investigated [Full Documentation]

Body: [Link to README with brief introduction]

I documented everything including a recorded call of Google attempting unauthorized access from their official support number.

See the screenshot: 31,800 subscribers, 9,145 views. You do the math.
```

### LinkedIn:
```
[Professional tone version focusing on small business impact]

As a content creator, I invested $2,100 in Google Ads to grow my YouTube channel. The campaign reported exceptional results—33,000+ subscribers with a 78% conversion rate.

Eight months later, my channel has 31,800 subscribers but only 9,145 total views.

The math doesn't work. You cannot subscribe to a YouTube channel without viewing content first. Yet somehow, my channel has 3.5x more subscribers than views.

When I began documenting these anomalies and contacting Google support, something unusual happened: I received a call from Google's official support line, and during that call, they attempted to gain unauthorized access to my entire Google account. I declined and have the full interaction recorded.

This raises serious questions about advertising platform integrity, especially for small businesses making decisions based on reported metrics.

## KEY TALKING POINTS:

Use these in any format:

1. **The Screenshot** - 31,800 subs / 9,145 views = impossible
2. **The Unauthorized Access** - Google tried to hack the account (recorded)
3. **The Timeline** - 8 months later, still dead, still losing subs
4. **The Question** - If this happened to me, how many others?
5. **The Evidence** - Everything documented, recorded, preserved

---

## CALLS TO ACTION:

**Always end with ONE of these:**

For Investigation:
- "Share if you think this deserves investigation"
- "Contact me if you've experienced similar issues"

For Media:
- "Looking for journalists to investigate this story"
- "Full evidence package available to credentialed media"

For Legal:
- "Seeking legal representation"
- "Lawyers specializing in tech/advertising fraud, DM me"

For Community:
- "Has this happened to you with Google Ads?"
- "How many others are affected?"

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO:

❌ Don't dump all files at once - use the README as entry  
❌ Don't lead with "I need money" - lead with the fraud  
❌ Don't be emotional/ranty - stay factual  
❌ Don't threaten Google - present facts, let them speak  
❌ Don't claim things you can't prove - stick to documented facts  

✅ Lead with the screenshot - it proves everything  
✅ Stay calm and factual - the facts are shocking enough  
✅ Offer evidence to serious inquiries - don't dump it publicly yet  
✅ Focus on "how many others" - makes it bigger than you  
✅ Be available but selective - respond to serious interest
